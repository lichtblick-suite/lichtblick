/**
 * Defines the maximum number of transforms across time stored in a single
 * `CoordinateFrame`.
 * We store a history of transforms received so that Markers and other 3D elements
 * can reference the state of a CoordinateFrame transform at a particular time rather than
 * only storing the most recent frame.
 * Considerations for the setting of this value are:
 *  - the larger the value, the more memory is used per panel
 *  - the larger the value, the longer it can take to set transforms within the history
 *  - the larger the value, the more likely it is that objects will be able to reference transforms at older times.
 *    Note that this is highly dependent on the frequency transforms for a given frame are published.
 *    For example, for 50Hz transforms for a single frame and a value of 5,000 max capacity. The transform
 *    history will contain 100 seconds of history for this frame.
 *    For 1kHz transforms for a single frame and a value of 5,000 max capacity. The transform history would
 *    only store 5 seconds of history for this frame.
 *    If the object references a transform at a time older than the history, it will simply use the oldest transform for that frame
 *    which is not guaranteed to be accurate.
 *
 * We generally want to keep this higher to allow for larger transform histories, but
 * also want to be mindful to memory and performance concerns when doing so
 *
 * This number is mentioned in the docs. If changed docs must be updated.
