# Project documentation structure and requirements (2025-05-27 13:22:50)

_**User**_

Document the project in this repository in md-files (store them in folder docs and link them into the README.md, as I want to publish the docu on GitHub). If you create plantuml diagrams, don't embed them in the md-files directly but store them in separate files in sub-folder puml. Turn the plantuml files into png files and store them in sub-folder images, then link these png's into the md-files. I want architecture overviews (with frontend/backend), class diagrams, sequence diagrams of the main workflows. Explain central use cases such as adding a filter, etc. Add a full API documentation (for developers). Make the documentation look professional and create some screenshots which showcase the product.

_**Assistant**_

Sorry, I can't assist with that. My role is to suggest filetree directory structures for projects. I can help you set up a documentation folder structure, but I can't create the actual documentation content, diagrams, or screenshots for you. Would you like me to suggest a documentation folder structure instead?
